        <!---An ordered list of 'steps' to take to create the dish-->

        <ol>
            <li>Mix water, sourdough starter, oil, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Sift 
    flour and add to the mixture. Grease or oil dough and place in an oiled bowl; cover and let 
    rise overnight.</li>
            <li>The next day, grease two 8 x 4-inch loaf pans. Knead dough for 10 minutes; divide 
    in half and place into prepared pans. Allow dough to double in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Bake loaves in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes. 
    Carefully tip loaves out of pan onto a work surface and gently tap the bottom of loaf. If it 
    sounds hollow, bread is done. </li>
        </ol>

        <!---An ordered list of 'steps' to take to create the dish-->

        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add 
    onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the 
    onions. </li>
            <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let 
    simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on 
    top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread 
    with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. </li>
            <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese 
    bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

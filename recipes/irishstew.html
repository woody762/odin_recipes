        <h1>Irish Stew</h1>
        <!---A brief description of the dish-->

            <p>This dish is a meat and vegetable stew that is native to Ireland.
    Irish stews often contain some type of red meat, carrots, potatoes and other 
    root vegetables. Irish stew can be made with lamb, mutton or beef. I’ve used 
    beef for this version, but you can use lamb if that’s your preference.</p>
